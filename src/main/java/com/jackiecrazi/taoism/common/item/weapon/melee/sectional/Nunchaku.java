    /*
     * A flexible blunt weapon that still hurts. High power and defense, medium speed and combo, low range
     * Can be wielded in one or two hands, so it functions both as a single weapon and in pairs
     * Normal attack inflicts slowness 1/(qi/3)
     * Alt attack (only available when single wielded) makes a small sweep with radius 2
     * Riposte:
     * when one handed, attack changes to alt for the next 3 hits
     * when two handed, leap behind the opponent, inflicting slow 2/infinite, gain rooted 1/30 (no knockback),
     * and causes the opponent to lose 5 bars of oxygen per second in a choke hold. Lasts until distance > 3

    诛戮之剑
    After striking an enemy once, its sins will manifest as tormented spirits in a small area around the enemy
    The enemy is now "on trial". Attacking any entity will end the trial and release the spirits as a small shockwave
    the spirits can be collected by walking over them, each opens one eye of judgement.
    When opponent's hp is less than eye^2, mark the enemy for judgement.
    A judged enemy instantly dies, stuns nearby enemies and is guaranteed to drop a head on attack.
    If you attack before the enemy is judged, it still deals normal damage
    Every 5 damage taken reduces an eye
    Riposte: when looking at a spirit or the defendant, gain a speed boost

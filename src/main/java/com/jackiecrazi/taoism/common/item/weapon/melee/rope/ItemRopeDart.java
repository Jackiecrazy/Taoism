    /*
     * A rope weapon that charges up into fast, unblockable and constricting hits. High speed and range, medium power and defense, low combo
     * Two handed.
     * Stores up charge when in hand, to a cap, released during an attack. Cannot block or parry.
     * Normal attack, notably, throws out a projectile instead of actually attacking, damage and velocity determined by charge.
     * This means it naturally ignores non-shield blocks.
     * Alt attack is an arcing overhead smash. This ignores all forms of blocking, and bind 1/4 on first hit entity.
     * The alt attack is capable of snatching projectiles from midair, which can then be fired in any direction.
     * If the grabbed object is not a projectile, it will instead draw them in.
     * Escape velocity for bound entity and catch threshold for projectile are both based on charge.

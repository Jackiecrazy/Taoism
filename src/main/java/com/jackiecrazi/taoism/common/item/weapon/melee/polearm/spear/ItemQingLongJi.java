    /*
     * A polearm capable of continuous attack. High range and combo, medium defense and power, low speed
     * I have to admit, this is technically a pollaxe, but it handles much more like a spear with a cutting edge, and pollaxes are getting crowded.
     * Two-handed, range 6, attack speed 1.4(+chi/2)
     * Normal attack is a simple stab that inflicts (1.5+chi/10)x damage.
     * Alt will switch sides, dealing splash 3 (+chi/5) and inflicting slow 1/(chi/10) if on blunt end, and cutting damage if on sharp end
     * Notably, only alternating attacks will accumulate chi, and chi is directly tied to attack speed.
     * Riposte: instantly gain two layers of chi.

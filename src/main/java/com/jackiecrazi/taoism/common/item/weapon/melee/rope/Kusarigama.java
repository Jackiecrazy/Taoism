     * A sickle attached to a weighted chain. High power and speed, medium defense and combo, low range
     * Two handed, you hold the sickle in the offhand by default. Chain cannot block, but will store up charge by being held.
     * By default:
     * Left clicking once will throw the ball, bind charge/2; another click will drag them in
     * Right click will throw sickle if target's far, stacking hemorrhage 1/7 with 1 second cooldown, and if less than 2 blocks will stack 2/5
     * In alternate stance:
     * Left click will function as per right click in default
     * Right click will arc the ball in an overhead smash that inflicts slow 1/charge
     * Parry special: reset enemy attack timer. Sickle will detonate hemorrhage into 2 piercing damage per layer

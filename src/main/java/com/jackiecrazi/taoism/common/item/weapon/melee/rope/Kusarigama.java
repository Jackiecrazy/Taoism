     * A sickle attached to a weighted chain. High power and speed, medium defense and combo, low range
     * Two handed, you hold the sickle in the offhand by default. Chain cannot block, but will store up charge by being held.
     * By default:
     * Left clicking once will throw the ball, bind charge/2; another click will drag them in
     * Right click will throw sickle if target's far, expending charge, and if less than 2

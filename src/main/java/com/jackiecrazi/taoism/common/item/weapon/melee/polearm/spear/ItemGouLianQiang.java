    /*
    A spear weapon that specializes in hooking and grabbing. High range and speed, medium combo and defense, low power
    Reference: a guisarme can be used to catch incoming blades
    A guisarme can hook down an overhead parry for a stab
    A goulian qiang has a blunt hook used for pulling. It's mainly used to pull people off horses, pull people off balance or trip horses
    I imagine the cavity would lead to great...??? I don't remember my train of thought...
    Anyway this trips people and counters parries.

    left click for a normal stab. Doing this attack twice in a row will grab and trip, inflicting (2+armor/5) posture damage
    right click to do a bash that knocks the target a fair distance away and inflicts blunt damage, at cost of lower damage
    These two attacks have independent cooldowns,so you can continuously chain them.
    this loses the spear's ability to pierce. Instead, when you are parried, your attack counter immediately resets;
        Attacking again within a 0.5s time will disable parrying for 1.2 seconds.
    riposte:
    //the next bash in 4 seconds AoEs, knocks back and briefly slows the opponents
    //the next stab in 4 seconds instantly hooks and trips
